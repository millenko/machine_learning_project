    "Organizing Jupyter Notebooks effectively can help maintain clarity, reproducibility, and ease of collaboration. Here are some best practices for organizing and structuring your Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Use Clear and Descriptive Titles and Headers**\n",
    "- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title at the top of your notebook.\n",
    "- **Headers**: Organize your notebook into sections using Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.).\n",
    "  ```markdown\n",
    "  # Project Title\n",
    "  ## Section 1: Data Loading\n",
    "  ### Section 1.1: Import Libraries\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Table of Contents**\n",
    "- Create a table of contents at the beginning of the notebook for easy navigation. You can use the `toc` extension from JupyterLab or manually create one with Markdown.\n",
    "  ```markdown\n",
    "  # Table of Contents\n",
    "  1. [Introduction](#Introduction)\n",
    "  2. [Data Loading](#Data-Loading)\n",
    "  3. [Data Cleaning](#Data-Cleaning)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Keep Code and Outputs Organized**\n",
    "- **Cell Structure**: Keep related code and outputs in the same cell to maintain context.\n",
    "- **Separate Sections**: Use separate cells for different logical sections of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Document Your Code**\n",
    "- Use Markdown cells to explain the purpose of the code, the methodology, and the results.\n",
    "- Comment your code generously to explain complex logic or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Consistent Naming Conventions**\n",
    "- Use clear and consistent variable names.\n",
    "- Avoid using single-letter variable names except for loop counters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Modularize Code**\n",
    "- Break down your code into functions or classes to make it reusable and easier to read.\n",
    "- Place reusable functions in a separate script or module that you can import into your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Use Version Control**\n",
    "- Use Git for version control. Commit your notebooks and related scripts to a Git repository.\n",
    "- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files (like `.ipynb_checkpoints`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Environment Management**\n",
    "- Document the environment and dependencies used in the notebook. You can use tools like `pip freeze` or `conda list`.\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  # Save dependencies to a requirements file\n",
    "  pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Use Jupyter Notebook Extensions**\n",
    "- Utilize Jupyter Notebook extensions like `nbextensions` to enhance functionality (e.g., Table of Contents, code folding).\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  # Install nbextensions\n",
    "  pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
    "  jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Organize Data and Outputs**\n",
    "- Keep your data, notebooks, and outputs in a well-organized directory structure.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  project/\n",
    "  ├── data/\n",
    "  │   ├── raw/\n",
    "  │   └── processed/\n",
    "  ├── notebooks/\n",
    "  │   ├── exploration.ipynb\n",
    "  │   └── analysis.ipynb\n",
    "  ├── scripts/\n",
    "  │   └── utils.py\n",
    "  ├── outputs/\n",
    "  │   ├── figures/\n",
    "  │   └── tables/\n",
    "  └── README.md\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Use JupyterLab for Enhanced Productivity**\n",
    "- JupyterLab provides a more flexible and powerful interface for working with notebooks, including file browsing, text editors, and terminal access in one interface.\n",
    "\n",
